## Hi there! ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m a so-called amateur robotics enthusiats embarking on a wild journey of DIY tech and quirky experiments.

### What I'm Up To
- **Learning by Doing:**
  ðŸ¦¿ I'm starting from the basics of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Every bug and breakthrough is a lesson in disguise.
  
- **Building Cool Stuff:**  
  ðŸ¦¾ I'm trying to assembling a SO-100 arm and deploy some hands-on training on it, with plenty of trial and error (and coffee)!
