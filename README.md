## Hi there! 🤖👋
🤔 I’m a so-called amateur robotics enthusiast, embarking on a wild journey of DIY tech and quirky experiments.

### What I'm Up To
- **Learning by Doing:**  
  🤓 I'm starting from the basics of MPC Control and Reinforcement Learning. Every bug and breakthrough is a lesson in disguise.
  
- **Building Cool Stuff:**  
  🛠️ I'm trying to assemble a SO-100 arm and deploy some hands-on trainings on it, with plenty of trial and error (and coffee)!

- **Following New Trends:**  
  🧐 I'm updating a weekly report on the robotics field, covering brilliant projects, innovative methods, and other interesting topics.

- **Having Some Fun:**  
  🎮 I'm a typical otaku who enjoys animes and games in my spare time (especially those made by Type Moon and FromSoftware)

### Let's Connect!

🥸 I love collaborating on projects, sharing ideas, or even just geeking out about the latest animes or games. If you have a cool idea or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me under any posts of my personal blog (under construction).

🫡 Thanks for stopping by my GitHub space—let’s build something extraordinary together!
